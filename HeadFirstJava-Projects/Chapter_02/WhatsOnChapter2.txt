A Trip to Objectville
I was told there would be objects. In Chapter 1, we put all of our code in
the main() method. That’s not exactly object-oriented. So now we’ve got to leave that
procedural world behind and start making some objects of our own. We’ll look at what
makes object-oriented (OO) development in Java so much fun. We’ll look at the difference
between a class and an object. We’ll look at how objects can improve your life.
